\section{History and Definition}

The history about this term begins near the year 2008 \cite{DefineGamefication}. 
It was coined to summarise the use of game elements on non-game contexts.
In the year 2010 the term reached the critical mass to appear on Google
Trends\cite{LiCap1.3}.

The idea of this concept initially was use on the 80s to make an upgrade to a 
game called MUD \emph{Multy User Dungeons}. The person behind this was Richard Bartle
who begin to analise the people who played this games and found 4 stereotypes of
players,\ref{fig:Players}.

With this types of players he developed a new MUD to satisfy each type of player.
After the sucess of the idea of focus certein aspects of the game to engage the players
the non-game industry began to use game elements to engage people over their products.

Nowadays Gamification has become a really useful tool to engage people. With this in
mind the industry and people are in the need of a description that can contain
all the ideas about it. \emph{Gamification} is \emph{the use of game design elements
in non-game related contexts}:

\begin{itemize}

\item Game: This relates to \emph{games} and not to \emph{play}. The idea of game is
characterized by explicit rules that make a context where the competition or strife
of actors let them go towars goals or achievements.    

\item Game elements: Within this concept there are two definitions. The first,
only accept certain unique elements. This is a very constraint approach were the set
of useful elements is a very tight. The other definition is a boundless one were every
element from every game can be use. With this two ideas we can create a more restrict 
definition were the elements to use are characteristic to games, that are
found in most (but not necessarily all) games, found to play a significant role in gameplay. 

\item Design: Designer distingushes between a regular game and a gamified aplication 
is that they are build with diferents inttentions. Gamified solutions are created to 
include elements from games. The chart,\ref{Chart:Levels}, shows the levels of 
abstraction of game design elements.

\item Non-Game Context: This concept is really hard to explain because is a really
abtract idea. This can be undetstand like a real life situation that exist  outside
 of the video game or gamified environment.

\emph{Gamification} is not about entretein to engage the costumer, is all about the 
motivation that drives the user to comeback. When a constumer is motivated to use the 
platform, they would do almost anything to keep using it and this is what 
\emph{gamification} looks for. 
With this in mind there are three element of motivation
